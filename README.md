# Backend Development Repository

This workspace appears to be the source files for a XAMPP dashboard and accompanying documentation. It includes:

- `dashboard/` with HTML/PHP pages for FAQ, how-tos, index, and documentation files
- Various language-specific directories (`de/`, `es/`, `fr/`, etc.) containing localized versions of documentation
- `acme/` web application structure with PHP modules and templates
- `docs/` containing guides for working with XAMPP, PHP, MySQL, and related tasks

## Purpose

The repository seems designed to host examples, documentation, and utilities for setting up and using XAMPP and associated PHP applications. It may serve as a learning environment or starter kit for web development with PHP.

## Getting Started

1. Install [XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html).
2. Place the contents of this repository in your XAMPP `htdocs` directory.
3. Navigate to `http://localhost/dashboard/` in your browser to view the dashboard.
4. Explore the localized `faq.html`, `howto.html`, and other resources.
